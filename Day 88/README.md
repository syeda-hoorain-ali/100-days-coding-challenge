## Creating Layouts and Pages

Creating layouts in Next.js allows you to maintain consistent structure and design across different pages of your application. By defining reusable layout components, you can avoid code duplication and ensure a cohesive look and feel.

## Navigating Between Pages

Navigating between pages in Next.js is seamless and efficient. Using the built-in `Link` component, you can create fast, client-side transitions between routes in your application.
