## Partial Prerendering

Partial prerendering in Next.js is a technique that allows you to prerender static parts of your page while leaving dynamic parts to be rendered on the client side. This approach provides a balance between performance and flexibility, ensuring that critical content is delivered quickly while allowing for dynamic updates as needed.


### Conclusion

Partial prerendering enables you to optimize the performance of your Next.js application by serving static content quickly while allowing dynamic updates when necessary. By leveraging hybrid rendering techniques and Incremental Static Regeneration, you can ensure your application remains fast and responsive.
