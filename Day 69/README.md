## Enums in TypeScript

Today, we'll dive into TypeScript enums, which allow you to define a set of named constants. Enums make it easier to document intent or create a set of distinct cases. This guide covers numeric enums, string enums, and heterogeneous enums.

### Tasks
1. **Numeric Enums**: Define a numeric enum and use it in your code.
2. **String Enums**: Create a string enum and demonstrate its usage.
3. **Heterogeneous Enums**: Explore heterogeneous enums and their applications.
4. **Enum Member Types**: Use enum types to create variables and function parameters.
5. **Computed and Constant Members**: Understand the difference between computed and constant members in enums.
