## 🚀 Day 5 Challenge: Start Coding! 🚀

- **Question 13:** Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

- **Question 14:** Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

- **Question 15:** Changing Guest List: One of your guests can't make it to the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations with a replacement guest.
