## CSS Styling

Styling your Next.js application can be done using various methods, including global CSS, CSS modules, and styled-jsx. Each method has its use cases and advantages, allowing you to create aesthetically pleasing and maintainable styles for your components.

### Key Concepts:
- **Global CSS**: Apply styles globally across the entire application.
- **CSS Modules**: Scope CSS to individual components to avoid class name conflicts.
- **Styled JSX**: Write scoped CSS directly in your components using template literals.

## Optimizing Fonts and Images

Optimizing fonts and images is crucial for improving the performance and user experience of your Next.js application. Proper optimization techniques can lead to faster load times and better visual rendering.

### Key Concepts:
- **Font Optimization**: Load custom fonts efficiently using the built-in font optimization feature in Next.js.
- **Image Optimization**: Use the `next/image` component to automatically optimize images.
- **Image Loading Strategies**: Use `priority` and `loading` attributes to control how and when images are loaded.
- **Responsive Images**: Automatically serve appropriately sized images for different screen sizes.
