    <h1>Task: Output prime numbers</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.</li>
        <li>In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it canâ€™t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.</li>
        <li>For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.</li>
        <li><b>Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.</b></li>
        <li>For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.</li>
        <li>P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value.</li>
    </ul>

    <script>
        let n = 10;

        for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            let isPrime = true;

            for (let j = 2; j < i; j++) {
                if (i % j === 0) {
                    isPrime = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (isPrime) alert(i);
