## Loops: while and for

Loops are fundamental to programming, allowing repetitive execution of code blocks. This section explores the `while` and `for` loops in JavaScript, demonstrating their syntax and use cases.

### Tasks
1. What is the last value alerted by this code? Why?
    ```js
    let i = 3;
    while (i) {
        alert( i-- );
    }
    ```
2. Which values does the while loop show?
    - For every loop iteration, write down which value it outputs and then compare it with the solution.
    - Both loops alert the same values, or not?

    - The prefix form ++i:
    ```js
    let i = 0;
    while (++i < 5) alert( i );
    ```

    - The postfix form i++:
    ```js
    let i = 0;
    while (i++ < 5) alert( i );
    ```

3. Which values get shown by the "for" loop?
    - For each loop write down which values it is going to show. Then compare with the answer.
    - Both loops alert same values or not?
    - The postfix form:
    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) alert( i );
    ```
    - The prefix form:
    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) alert( i );
    ```

4. Use the for loop to output even numbers from 2 to 10.

5. Replace "for" with "while"
    - Rewrite the code changing the for loop to while without altering its behavior (the output should stay same).
    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        alert( `number ${i}!` );
    }
    ```

6. Repeat until the input is correct
    - Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number â€“ ask them to input again.
    - The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.
    - Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. Thereâ€™s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.

7. Output prime numbers
    - An integer number greater than `1` is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except `1` and itself.
    - In other words, `n > 1` is a prime if it canâ€™t be evenly divided by anything except `1` and `n`.
    - For example, `5` is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by `2`, `3` and `4`.
    - **Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from `2` to `n`.**
    - For `n = 10` the result will be `2,3,5,7`.
    - P.S. The code should work for any `n`, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value.

## The "switch" statement

The `switch` statement provides a way to execute different code blocks based on the value of a variable. It's an alternative to using multiple `if...else` statements, making code easier to read and maintain.

### Tasks
1. Write the code using if..else which would correspond to the following switch:
    ```js
    switch (browser) {
        case 'Edge':
            alert( "You've got the Edge!" );
            break;

        case 'Chrome':
        case 'Firefox':
        case 'Safari':
        case 'Opera':
            alert( 'Okay we support these browsers too' );
            break;

        default:
            alert( 'We hope that this page looks ok!' );
    }
    ```

2. Rewrite the code below using a single switch statement:
    ```js
    let a = +prompt('a?', '');

    if (a == 0) {
        alert( 0 );
    }
    if (a == 1) {
        alert( 1 );
    }

    if (a == 2 || a == 3) {
        alert( '2,3' );
    }
    ```
