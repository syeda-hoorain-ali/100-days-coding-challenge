## Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript enhances JavaScript by adding static types, which help catch errors early and make the code more predictable. This section provides a simple introduction to TypeScript, its benefits, and basic concepts.

### Overview
- **What is TypeScript?**  
  TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It offers optional static typing, classes, and interfaces, which can improve development efficiency and code robustness.

- **Why use TypeScript?**  
  TypeScript helps in identifying errors at compile time, provides better tooling with IntelliSense, and ensures better collaboration through self-documenting code.

### Tasks
1. Read through the introduction to understand the basic concepts of TypeScript.
2. Write a simple TypeScript program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Setting Up TypeScript

Setting up TypeScript is straightforward and can be done in a few steps. This section provides a step-by-step guide to get TypeScript up and running in your development environment.

### Overview
- **Step-by-Step Setup Guide**  
  Follow the detailed guide to install TypeScript, configure the compiler, and integrate it into your project. This will include installing Node.js, setting up a `tsconfig.json` file, and running the TypeScript compiler.

### Tasks
1. Follow the setup guide to install TypeScript in your development environment.
2. Configure a new or existing project to use TypeScript by creating and configuring a `tsconfig.json` file.
