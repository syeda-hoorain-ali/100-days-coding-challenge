## Generics in TypeScript

Today, we will explore TypeScript generics, which provide a way to create reusable and flexible components. Generics allow you to write functions, classes, and interfaces that can work with any data type. This guide covers the basics of defining generics, using generic constraints, and applying generics in various scenarios.

### Tasks
1. **Basic Generics**: Define a simple generic function that works with multiple data types.
2. **Generic Constraints**: Use constraints to restrict the kinds of types that a generic function can accept.
3. **Generic Classes**: Create a generic class that operates on different data types.
4. **Generic Interfaces**: Define an interface that uses generics to ensure type safety.
5. **Using Generics with Arrays**: Implement generics in functions that work with arrays of various types.
