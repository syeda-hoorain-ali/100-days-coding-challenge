## 🚀 Day 9 Challenge: Start Coding! 🚀

- **Question 25:** Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
    - Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

    - Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

- **Question 26:** Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien, then write an if-else chain.
    - If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

    - If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

    - Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

- **Question 27:** Alien Colors #3: Convert your if-else chain to handle three colors: green, yellow, red.

    - If the alien is green, print a message that the player earned 5 points.

    - If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player earned 10 points.

    - If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.

    - Write three versions of this program, making sure each message is printed for the appropriate color alien.
