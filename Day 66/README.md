## TypeScript Type System Concepts

Today, we'll explore various concepts in the TypeScript type system. This includes advanced types, type inference, and type compatibility. Understanding these concepts will help you write more flexible and powerful TypeScript code.

### Tasks
1. **Type Inference**: Observe how TypeScript infers types without explicit annotations. Create a few variables and functions to see type inference in action.
2. **Type Aliases**: Define type aliases for complex types to simplify code and improve readability.
3. **Type Assertions**: Use type assertions to override inferred types when you know more about a value's type than TypeScript does.
4. **Literal Types**: Create variables with literal types to restrict their values to specific strings or numbers.
5. **Intersection and Union Types**: Combine types using intersection (`&`) and union (`|`) operators to create more flexible types.
6. **Type Compatibility**: Explore how TypeScript checks if types are compatible, allowing different types to be assigned to variables.
