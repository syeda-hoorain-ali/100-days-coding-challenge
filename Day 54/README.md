## Hello World

The "Hello, World!" tutorial is an introduction to JavaScript, guiding you through creating your first script that displays a message.


### Tasks
1. Create a page that shows a message ‚ÄúI‚Äôm JavaScript!‚Äù.
2. Modify the previous task to extract the script content into an external file `alert.js`.


## Variables 

The "Variables" tutorial covers how to declare and use variables in JavaScript, including best practices for naming and assigning values.

### Tasks

1. **Working with variables**
    - Declare two variables: `admin` and `name`.
    - Assign the value "John" to `name`.
    - Copy the value from `name` to `admin`.
    - Show the value of `admin` using alert (must output ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù).
2. **Giving the right name**
    - Create a variable for the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
    - Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?
3. **Uppercase const**

    - Examine the following code:
    ```js
    const birthday = '18.04.1982';
    const age = someCode(birthday);
    ```

    - Would it be right to use uppercase for `birthday`? For `age`? Or even for both?
    ```js
    const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; // make birthday uppercase?
    const AGE = someCode(BIRTHDAY); // make age uppercase?
    ```
