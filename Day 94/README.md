## Search Functionality

Adding search functionality to a Next.js application enhances user experience by allowing users to quickly find the content they are looking for. Implementing search typically involves creating a search input field and filtering the displayed results based on the user's query.

## Pagination

Pagination allows you to divide a large set of data into smaller chunks, making it easier to navigate and manage. This improves performance and usability, especially when dealing with extensive datasets.

### Conclusion

Implementing search and pagination in your Next.js application greatly improves usability by making it easier for users to find and navigate through content. These features are essential for applications dealing with large datasets or extensive content lists.
