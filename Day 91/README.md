## Static Rendering

Static rendering in Next.js refers to generating the HTML of your pages at build time. This means that when you build your application, the HTML is pre-generated and served to the client as static files. This method is highly efficient for content that does not change frequently, providing fast load times and improved SEO.


## Dynamic Rendering

Dynamic rendering in Next.js involves generating the HTML of your pages at request time. This means the HTML is generated on the server for each request, allowing you to serve content that changes frequently or is personalized for each user. This approach is useful for applications that require real-time data or user-specific content.

### Conclusion

Understanding the differences between static and dynamic rendering is crucial for optimizing your Next.js application. Static rendering is excellent for content that doesn't change often, providing fast load times and better SEO. Dynamic rendering is essential for real-time or personalized data, ensuring that the most current data is served to the user.
