// Question 20: Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
const cities = ['Karachi', 'KPK', 'Lahore', 'Islamabad'];
console.log("List of Cities:");
cities.forEach(city => {
    console.log(city);
});
export {};
