## Streaming

Streaming in Next.js allows you to send parts of your HTML to the browser as they become available, rather than waiting for the entire page to be ready. This improves performance by allowing users to see and interact with parts of the page while the rest is still loading. This feature is especially useful for data-heavy applications or pages with complex components that take time to render.

### Conclusion

Streaming in Next.js enhances the user experience by improving the perceived performance of your application. By sending parts of the HTML to the client as they are ready, users can begin interacting with your page sooner, leading to a smoother and more responsive experience. This technique is particularly valuable for complex and data-intensive applications.
