## What are Web Vitals?

Web Vitals are like health checkups for websites. They measure how fast a website loads, how quickly you can interact with it, and if it's stable while you're using it. These things are important because they affect how enjoyable and useful a website is for people. So, by paying attention to Web Vitals, website creators can make sure their sites are fast, responsive, and easy to use for everyone.
