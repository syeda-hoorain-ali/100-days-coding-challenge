## Tuple Data Type in TypeScript

TypeScript tuples are arrays where the type of each element is known. They are fixed in length and their elements can be of different types.

### Tasks
1. **Declare a Tuple:** Declare a tuple variable in TypeScript with at least three elements, each of a different type. Access and print each element of the tuple.
2. **Changing Values:** Try to update value of a tuple. Verify the changes by logging the tuple.
3. **Tuple Destructuring:** Use tuple destructuring to extract values from a tuple into separate variables. Perform operations with these variables and print the results.
