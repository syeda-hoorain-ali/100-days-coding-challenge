## Type Assertions in TypeScript

Today, we'll focus on TypeScript type assertions, which allow you to override TypeScript's inferred types. This can be useful when you know more about the type of a value than TypeScript does. This guide covers basic type assertions, using the `as` keyword, and the angle-bracket syntax.

### Tasks
1. **Basic Type Assertions**: Use the `as` keyword to assert a specific type.
2. **Angle-Bracket Syntax**: Apply the angle-bracket syntax for type assertions.
3. **Asserting with DOM Elements**: Use type assertions to work with DOM elements in a type-safe manner.
4. **Double Assertions**: Implement double assertions for cases where two assertions are necessary.
