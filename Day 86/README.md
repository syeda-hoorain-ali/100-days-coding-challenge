## Learn Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that offers various features such as server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes. It simplifies the process of building and deploying modern web applications by providing built-in functionalities and a structured approach to development.

## Getting Started

Starting with Next.js involves setting up the development environment, understanding the file structure, and learning the basics of creating and managing pages. This setup allows developers to quickly build and deploy scalable web applications.

### Steps to Get Started:
1. **Setup Project**:
   - Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
   - Create a new Next.js project:
     ```bash
     npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example"
     cd nextjs-dashboard
     ```

2. **Running the Development Server**:
   - Start the development server and open the application in your browser:
     ```bash
	 npm i
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
