## Updating UI with JavaScript

In React, updating the UI dynamically in response to user interactions or data changes is a fundamental concept. React handles UI updates efficiently by re-rendering components when their state or props change. This process ensures that the UI stays in sync with the application's data.


## Getting Started with React

Getting started with React involves setting up the development environment, creating your first components, and understanding the basics of how React works. This foundational knowledge is essential for building complex and interactive web applications.
