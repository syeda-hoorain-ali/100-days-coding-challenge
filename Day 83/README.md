## Building UI with Components

React components are the foundational building blocks of any React application. By breaking the UI into smaller, reusable pieces, components help create a modular and maintainable code structure. Components can be either functional or class-based, each with its specific use cases and advantages.


## Displaying Data with Props

Props, short for "properties," are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are read-only and help make components dynamic by rendering different outputs based on the passed data. Utilizing props enables the creation of reusable and customizable components.
